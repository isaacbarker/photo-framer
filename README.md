# PhotoFramer

**A python based tool which converts images in batches from their own dimensions and ratios to the 
ideal Instagram aspect ratio and dimensions by adding a coloured frame as a background, also adding to the 
astethic of your grid.**

Specifically this program takes input `.jpg` images and resizes them to fit on a 1080x1350 coloured canvas with
padding decided by the `margin` variable. Through this process a framed image with a 4:5 aspect ratio is obtained while still retaining the original ratio of the input image within.
